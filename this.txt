Okay, This is a KotlinJS implmentation with NodeJS.
to run type: npm start
to rebuld type: gradle build

to start this project from scratch again:

copy paste this build.gradle file
then npm init 
npm install kotlin --save
npm install express --save 

then create the folders in order 
mkdir /src
mkdir /src/main
mkdir /src/main/kotlin

add  "start": "node node/index.js" to package.json file
then npm start

if npm is out out of date: 

install nvm! (Node Version Manager)

https://github.com/creationix/nvm

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | bash

then

nvm install 'latest version of node'

then npm start should work!

the reason why this is useful: 

Kotlin is just like java, so whatever you write is a lot easier than relearning js.
Plus with a NodeJS implmentation it's a lot easier than doing server stuff in java anyways
If you want Node libraries or any js libraries, no problem
JavaFX or java libraries? No problem
this all compliles into an easy to use package, with admittedly not very much overhead. 
It all works in the terminal
